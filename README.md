## Cbot-cli Basics

The application is a C script that prompts the Llama/Ollama text completion endpoint with a system message and can identify the OS of the current system. This helps ensure that Linux, Mac, and Windows specific commands tend to be more accurate.

This project is a port of the original Cbot-cli python project into pure C.
